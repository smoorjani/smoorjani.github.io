Lonely Rock Paper Scissors (LRPS) allows you to play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors with your computer without having to do anything except play. There is no entering your move or telling the computer when to go. It all happens automatically. See our github repo [here](https://github.com/smoorjani/rock-paper-scissor).
