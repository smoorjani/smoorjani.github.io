I am a software engineer at Databricks on the Lakehouse Monitoring (ML Data) team. I graduated with my BS+MS in Computer Science from [UIUC](https://illinois.edu/) advised by [Hari Sundaram](http://sundaram.cs.illinois.edu/). I am interested in controllable natural language generation, specifically for complex metrics (e.g., speed, volume, circuitousness) and infusing styles that are not quantifiable (e.g. memorability, persuasion) into text.

See my updated resume [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19UJ3voazJUr8UzZZLHy5K9lLix1CSU6U7LB_RrSOP6U/edit#). See my (probably not) updated CV [here](http://smoorjani.github.io/files/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).

Research
======
I worked with [Hari Sundaram](http://sundaram.cs.illinois.edu/) and [Ewa Maslowska](https://media.illinois.edu/advertising/maslowska-ewa) in the [Crowd Dynamics Lab](https://crowddynamicslab.github.io/) from May 2021 to May 2023. We operated at the intersection of natural langauge processing and advertising theory to be able to generate more appealing and interpretable science and combat the spread of scientific misinformation.

I have also worked in the [IMPACT group](http://impact.crhc.illinois.edu/), directed by [Wen-mei Hwu](https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/faculty/w-hwu), from August 2020 to December 2022. I joined through the [Undergraduate Research in AI](https://students.grainger.illinois.edu/research/c3sr/) program hosted by the [IBM-Illinois Center for Cognitive Computing Research (C3SR)](https://www.c3sr.com/). We worked on integrating a [faster sparse matrix multiplication kernel](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.14152.pdf) into [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) to interface with large language models like BERT. I was advised by [Vikram Sharma Mailthody](https://msharmavikram.github.io/) and [Mert Hidayetoglu](https://merthidayetoglu.github.io/).

Previous Experience
======
This past summer, I interned at [Applovin](https://www.applovin.com/) on the Research Science team where I worked on monitoring data pipeline/model health and improving ranking models by embedding creatives. Previously, I interned at [Meta](https://www.meta.com/) on the Ads Responsibility and Privacy team under [Minxing Liu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/1993-minxing-liu/). I worked on improving multimodal ad classificaiton using hierarchical multi-label classification methods. I also interned at [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) on the AI Commerce Multimodal team under [Yu (Hugo) Chen](http://academic.hugochan.net/) working on improving multilingual language models in low-resource settings and at [Capital One](https://www.capitalone.com/) on the NLP services team on enterprise named entity recognition.
